Method- A method is a function with a special receiver argument.
      - a method is just a function with a receiver argument.
      - The receiver appears in its own argument list between the func keyword and the method name.

generics- you can declare and use functions or types that are written to work with any of a set of types provided by calling code.

fuzzing- random data is run against your test in an attempt to find vulnerabilities or crash-causing inputs.

goroutines- to achieve parallelism(doing multiple tasks at the same time).
          - managed by GO runtime
          - lightweight
          - sync package is usually used to wait for the goroutines to be completed.
                - in sync we use Add,Wait,Done methods.
          - we can also use time.sleep to wait for goroutines to complete but is not usually preferred. 

race condition- more goroutines try to access same memory space.
              - Solution : mutex 

mutex- provides lock() over the memory.
     - has unlock()
     - readwrite (RWmutex) reading goroutine is terminated until write is all done.

Channels- to achieve concurrency(doing multiple tasks one after the other)
        - multiple goroutines talk with each other.
        - buffered channels can hold multiple values before they are read.


Gin - It is a web framework written in Golang. 
    - It features a Martini-like API, but with performance up to 40 times faster than Martini. 
    - for needed performance and productivity gin is most likely the option.
