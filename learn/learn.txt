goroutines- to achieve parallelism(doing multiple tasks at the same time).
          - managed by GO runtime
          - lightweight
          - sync package is usually used to wait for the goroutines to be completed.
                - in sync we use Add,Wait,Done methods.
          - we can also use time.sleep to wait for goroutines to complete but is not usually preferred. 

race condition- more goroutines try to access same memory space.
              - Solution : mutex 

mutex- provides lock() over the memory.
     - has unlock()
     - readwrite (RWmutex) reading goroutine is terminated until write is all done.

Channels- to achieve concurrency(doing multiple tasks one after the other)
        - multiple goroutines talk with each other.
